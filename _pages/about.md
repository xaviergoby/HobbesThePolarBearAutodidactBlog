I am an Irish/Norwegian currently completing his Bachelors degree in Aerospace Engineering in addition to having completed a minor in Computer Science with a track in Big Data & Artificial
Intelligence. In addition, I posses (and gratefully so) a very international background for I was born and have lived in Singapore in addition to having lived in Taiwan, Cyprus (on the Turkish
Republic of Norther Cyprus, TRNC, side of the divided island), Dubai and currently reside in Delft, The Netherlands. This "nomadic-like" upbringing of mine (i.e. studying in various different
educational systems) has, without a doubt, allowed me to foster a curious nature and an open-minded attitude as a means of viewing the world in which we live today in addition to the way in which I
perceive, analyse and ultimately approach the solving of complex-problems.

In addition to my academic background in Aerospace Engineering, I also possess a great deal of both academic (e.g. research paper & minor studies) and practical experience (e.g. computer vision &
algorithmic trading system) in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer science, (big) data analysis. It therefore goes with saying that I certainly do possess a great deal of
both enthusiasm and curiosity for these fields.
